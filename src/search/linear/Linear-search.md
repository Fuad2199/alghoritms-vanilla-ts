# 🔍 Linear Search Algorithm

**Linear search** is a simple searching algorithm where a list or dataset is traversed sequentially to find the desired value.

## 📌 How It Works

Linear search checks each element in the list one by one until:
- The desired value is found, or
- The end of the list is reached.

## ⚙️ Properties

- **Time Complexity**:  
  - Worst-case: **O(n)**, where *n* is the size of the array.
- **Space Complexity**:  
  - Requires **O(1)** extra space (constant memory).
- **Efficiency**:  
  - Suitable for **small datasets**.  
  - Often used as a **subroutine** in more complex algorithms.
