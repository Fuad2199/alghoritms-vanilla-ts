# 🧠 Algorithm Playground with Vanilla + TypeScript + Vite

This repository showcases various algorithm implementations using **Vanilla JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, and **Vite**.  
It is designed as a practical reference for solving algorithmic problems and understanding how these algorithms work in real scenarios.

## 📌 About the Project

The main purpose of this project is to demonstrate **how different algorithms work** through clear and well-organized examples.  
It is especially focused on **problem-solving** skills that are crucial for coding interviews and competitive programming.

## 🧩 Features

- ✅ Built with **TypeScript** and **Vite** for fast and modern development.
- ✅ Covers popular algorithmic problems from platforms like:
  - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
  - [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
  - [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/)
  - and more.
- ✅ Includes **custom problem examples** authored by me.
- ✅ Simple and clean folder structure for each algorithm.
- ✅ Focus on readability and educational value.
